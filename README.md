Predicting gasket prices using XGboost regressor
# ðŸ”© Gasket Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the price of gaskets using supervised learning techniques. This project explores various regression algorithms, model evaluation metrics, and feature engineering methods to deliver accurate price predictions.



##  Project Overview

In many industrial applications, understanding and forecasting the price of mechanical parts like gaskets is essential for cost estimation and budgeting. This project aims to:

- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Engineer meaningful features
- Train multiple regression models
- Evaluate model performance
- Deploy a trained model for real-world usage (optional)

##  Dataset

- The dataset consists of features relevant to gasket characteristics such as:
  - Material type
  - Dimensions
  - Quantity
  - Manufacturing parameters

> Note: The dataset used in this project is proprietary or has been anonymized for demonstration purposes.
